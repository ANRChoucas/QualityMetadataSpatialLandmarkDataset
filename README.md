This project contains two procedures to reproduce the results of the paper *M.-D. Van Damme, A.-M. Olteanu Raimond A method to produce metadata describing 
and assessing the quality of spatial landmark datasets in mountain area*:
- the first one describes the steps to reproduce data matching and then to have the results of a section of table 3
- the second describes the steps to compute all results in table 4 and the Uncertainty row from table 3
